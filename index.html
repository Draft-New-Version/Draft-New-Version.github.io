        <h2>Antibacterial Coatings Doctoral Researcher | University Teacher | Science Communicator | Sub-warden</h2>
        <p align="justify">I am an enthusiastic materials engineering PhD researcher, passionate about applied research and product development, project work and consumer innovation. My interests and ambitions are focused on helping to improve people’s lives! <br> 
            With the experience of working in a consumer healthcare environment during an extended fifteen-month industrial placement at GlaxoSmithKline (now Haleon), I enjoyed rapid progression to become a Product Chemistry Scientist after my first role as a New Product Development Scientist. </br> 
            I received an Integrated MChem Degree from University of Sussex in 2021. My dissertation work focused on nanoscience’s application in waste-water treatment. </br> Sponsored by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, I am currently developing more efficient and environmentally friendly antibacterial coatings in the Martin-Fabiani Group. 
            My co-supervisors are Elisa Mele and Tao Sun. The PhD studentship allows me to expand my skills beyond my MChem degree as I learn about soft matter, microbiology, and materials science. </br> 
            My strong work ethic and high motivation enable me to take pride in my work, achieve milestones on time, and meet high-quality standards, collaboratively or as an individual when required. </br> I also enjoy mentoring others; supporting them in their work and development. My hobbies include recreational ice skating, drawing and cooking.</p>
